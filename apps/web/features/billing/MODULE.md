## Purpose and boundary

This feature carries authenticated billing account, subscription, filing-package,
refund, unsupported-case, production-pilot, snapshot, and entitlement calls
through the committed generated API client. It deliberately contains no pricing,
provider-event transition, filing-readiness, refund, pilot, or authorization
policy. Those decisions belong to the backend billing capability.

`loadAnnualBillingEntitlements` shares the three supported annual-obligation
requests without interpreting the returned decisions. `presentBillingAccount`
maps the generated account wire fields once for workspace and archive consumers.

Annual purchase history and local renewal cancellation use the annual API. Recovery
classifies authentication and step-up failures without exposing internal errors.
Prices, terms, status and cancellation confirmations come from persisted backend facts.
