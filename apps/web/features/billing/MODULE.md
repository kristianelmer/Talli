## Purpose and boundary

This feature carries authenticated annual history and renewal cancellation,
historical refunds/cancellation, unsupported-case cleanup, production-pilot,
snapshot, and entitlement calls
through the committed generated API client. It deliberately contains no pricing,
provider-event transition, filing-readiness, refund, pilot, or authorization
policy. Those decisions belong to the backend billing capability.

`loadAnnualBillingEntitlements` shares the three supported annual-obligation
requests without interpreting the returned decisions. `presentBillingAccount`
maps the generated account wire fields once for workspace and archive consumers.

Annual purchase history and local renewal cancellation use the annual API. Recovery
classifies authentication and step-up failures without exposing internal errors.
Prices, terms, status and cancellation confirmations come from persisted backend facts.

Legacy account creation, subscription activation and filing-package purchase
methods and forms are retired. Workspace links to annual billing and exposes
previous-model cleanup only when historical account records exist.
