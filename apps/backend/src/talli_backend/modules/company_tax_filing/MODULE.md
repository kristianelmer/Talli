# Company Tax

Company Tax owns settlement capture facts and normalization. Ledger owns account selection and posting; Banking owns matching; Documents owns evidence storage. The application workflow composes those public contracts.

The first migration slice is #146. Annual tax estimates and filing remain in #152. Preview normalization preserves the characterized date-shape and binary64 rounding behavior; it does not certify a valid capture date, positive rounded Money, authorization, or available bank link.
