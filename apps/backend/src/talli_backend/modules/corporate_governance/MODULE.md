# Corporate governance backend capability

## Purpose and ownership

`corporate_governance` owns accounting-policy selection, corporate decisions,
shareholder loans, owner dividends, approval/finalization state, and deterministic
corporate-document semantics. Generic document metadata and private object
storage remain owned by `documents`; accounting entries remain owned by
`ledger`; bank facts remain owned by `banking`.

Issue #144 is the first of three serialized slices. It moves the supported
owner-dividend proposal, distributable-basis validation, approval, declaration,
payment recognition, and readiness state. Issue #145 adds shareholder loans.
Issue #148 moves annual-close decisions, deterministic PDF rendering, signing,
the complete artifact lifecycle, and performs the capability-stage exit.

## Public interface

Consumers import only `talli_backend.modules.corporate_governance.public`.
`OwnerDividendProposalCommand` carries persisted identity/shareholder facts, an
approved annual-basis snapshot, the exact owner-reviewed facts, meeting facts,
confirmations, and an amount in integer øre. The service normalizes and sorts
those values, verifies the reviewed snapshot, derives the exact proportional
largest-remainder allocation, enforces the characterized hard blocks, and
produces `CanonicalOwnerDividendDecision` with stable source and decision hashes.

`RegisterOwnerDividendDocumentsCommand` accepts only opaque `DocumentReference`
values plus immutable content evidence. It contains no bucket, storage-key, or
object-operation vocabulary. `FinalizeOwnerDividendCommand` and
`RecordOwnerDividendPaymentCommand` carry opaque `AccountingEntryReference` and
`BankTransactionReference` identities; they expose no accounts, ledger lines,
provider fields, or bank credentials.

The proposal vocabulary is `PersistedCompanyFacts`,
`PersistedShareholderFacts`, `ApprovedAnnualBasis`,
`ReviewedOwnerDividendFacts`, `ReviewedShareholderFacts`, `BoardMeeting`,
`BoardParticipant`, `BoardRole`, `BoardTreatmentMethod`, `GeneralMeeting`,
`MeetingForm`, `ShareholderBallot`, and `ShareholderVote`. The canonical result
uses `CanonicalOwnerDividendDecision`, `CanonicalBoardParticipant`,
`CanonicalDecisionShareholder`, `OwnerDividendFinancialTotals`,
`OwnerDividendFacts`, `OwnerDividendAllocation`, `OwnerDividendConfirmations`,
`ProposedOwnerDividend`, `OwnerDividendLifecycle`, and `OwnerDividendState`.
`PreparedOwnerDividendFinalization` and `PreparedOwnerDividendPayment` expose
only the normalized amounts and locked bank fact needed by the application
workflow; they do not expose persistence rows or choose accounts. The private
`OwnerDividendAccountingPolicy` keeps the characterized `no-holding-v1`
2050/2920/1920 mapping in Python.

Stable owned identities are `CorporateDecisionId`, `CorporateDocumentSetId`,
`CorporateArtifactId`, `CorporateEventId`, `CorporateFinalizationId`, and
`CorporateSourceReference`. Cross-capability correlations are the opaque
`DocumentReference`, `AccountingEntryReference`, and
`BankTransactionReference`. `OwnerDividendArtifactReference` identifies the
exact `CorporateArtifactKind` and immutable content evidence without exposing
storage. `ApproveOwnerDividendCommand` represents the owner facts-approval
transition. Adapter binding is declared only by
`corporate_governance_persistence_adapter` against
`CorporateGovernancePersistence`.

Expected failures cross the boundary only as `CorporateGovernanceError` with a
declared `CorporateGovernanceErrorCode`. The public contract contains no
FastAPI, Pydantic, database, Supabase, or web types.

## Workflow and persistence seam

`CorporateGovernancePersistence` is the sole outbound capability port. The
request-bound application workflow will authenticate one verified actor, open a
restricted forced-RLS PostgreSQL transaction, ask governance to prepare or
replay its mutation, collaborate with `documents`, `ledger`, and `banking` only
through their public contracts, and complete governance-owned state in the same
transaction. Provider selection, activation, credentials, consent, live calls,
customer bank data, and production banking remain outside this capability and
blocked independently by #189.

## Current slice state

The deterministic owner-dividend policy and transport-free contract are active
work for #144. The target schema, restricted adapter, generated FastAPI client,
expand/contract migrations, rollback/recutover evidence, and immutable gates
must be added before this slice exits. The existing Python subprocess renderer
is intentionally not reclassified as complete governance ownership; #148 must
move rendering in-process and remove the bridge before the full capability exits.
